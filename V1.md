# v.1

As stated in the [high-level goals](HighLevelGoals.md), v.1 is designed to be a 
Minimum Viable Product, basically on par with [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/).  This means 
that there are important features we *know* we want and need, but are post-v.1; these 
are in a separate [essential post-v.1 features doc](EssentialPostV1Features.md).

This document explains the contents of v.1 at a high-level.  There are also separate docs for 
low-level and precise descriptions of:
 * [binary encoding](TODO.md)
 * [text assembly language](TODO.md)
 * [opcode semantics](TODO.md)
 
(Currently in the process of importing/simplifying state of discussion on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YwPHB08b0nkISqKBNBWmke2Gb0obPXDQaXTGRVJ37xo)

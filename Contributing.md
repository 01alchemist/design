# Contributing to WebAssembly

WebAssembly is initially designed and implemented by browser vendors who are
interested in meeting a variaty of [use cases](UseCases.md). As design and
implementation progresses they'll need input and contributions from developers
interested in using WebAssembly.

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Reading the [WebAssembly design][].
2. Joining the IRC channel `irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly`.
3. Joining the [mailing list][].

With that background understood and communication set up, [fork][] the relevant
[WebAssembly repositories][] and send a [pull request][]. Someone from the
[workshop group][] can then merge your pull request.

Frequent and high-quality contributors will be invited to join the
[contributors group][]. Truly dedicated individuals will then be invited to the
[workshop group][].

As WebAssembly moves forward we expect to form an official standards body, which
will have its own contribution process to the specification.

Happy assembly!

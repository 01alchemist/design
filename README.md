# [WebAssembly Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly) Specification

This repository is for early discussion, drafting and strawman around
WebAssembly and, later, draft specification work.  Expect the contents to be in
flux.

A good starting point is the [high-level design goals](HighLevelGoals.md).

We've mapped out features we expect to ship:
 1. In [the MVP](MVP.md);
 2. Closely [after the MVP](EssentialPostMVPFeatures.md);
 3. In [future versions](FutureFeatures.md).

Join us on IRC: `irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly`.

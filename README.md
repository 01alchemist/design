# WebAssembly Community Group: Design

This repository details [WebAssembly][]'s design. The WebAssembly specification
will be drafted in a different repository.

**Expect the contents to be in flux: everything is still tentative.**

A good starting point is the [high-level design goals](HighLevelGoals.md),
followed by the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

We've mapped out features we expect to ship:
 1. In [the Minimum VIable Product](MVP.md) (MVP);
 2. Closely [after the MVP](EssentialPostMVPFeatures.md);
 3. In [future versions](FutureFeatures.md).

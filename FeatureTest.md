# Feature Test

Any feature not present in [the MVP](MVP.md) will have a corresponding feature
test. This allows polyfills to elegantly emulate a feature, and allows
developers to fallback to another implementation if they so desire.

Feature tests will be available from WebAssembly itself, as well as from
JavaScript.

Details
[are still be hashed out](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/90).

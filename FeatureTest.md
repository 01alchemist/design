# Feature Test

Any feature not present in [the MVP](MVP.md) will have a corresponding feature
test. This allows polyfills to elegantly emulate a feature, and allows
developers to fallback to another implementation if they so desire.

Feature tests will be available from
[WebAssembly itself](AstSemantics.md#feature-test), as well as from JavaScript.

See also [better feature testing support](FutureFeatures.md#better-feature-testing-support)
in future features.
